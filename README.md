# Fantasy_Football_Pick3_Wins_Pool

This script pulls from sports-reference.com and summarizes win totals based on a ten person 3 team pick 'em. I've been running this with a group of friends for 5+ years - it's simple and keeps us connected. 

You'll need to update the seed file in alignment with how your group drafts teams at the beginning of the season

Enjoy!
